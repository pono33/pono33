- ðŸ‘‹ Hey there! My name is Facundo but you can also call me Pono!, and I'm **rencently graduated data scientist!**  from Henry's Data Science Bootcamp, and I'm actively honing my skills and building a portfolio to showcase my journey.

* **Open source spirit:** My code is open for exploration and learning! Feel free to fork, pull, and collaborate, let's push the boundaries of data together!
* **A continuous learning curve:** This is a work in progress, just like my data science journey. You'll find a mix of completed projects and ongoing experiments, reflecting my growth and evolving interests.

- ðŸ‘€ **Iâ€™m interested in** diving deeper into the fascinating world of neural networks and generative AI. I'm eager to explore their potential for creating new Tools and Methods for Artistic Expression within neural networks and visual generative AI. "I'm still diving into the fascinating world of neural networks and generative AI, and I'm eager to learn through hands-on projects.

- ðŸŒ± Currently expanding my knowledge in TensorFlow with the goal of certification. If you have any suggestions for beginner-friendly projects or resources, I'd be thrilled to hear them!
  
- ðŸ“« I'm always eager to chat about data, learn from like-minded folks, and collaborate on cool projects. Reach out via:
